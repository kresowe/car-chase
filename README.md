# Car chase
This is a simple app written in Python to illustrate the typical problem in kinematics, the chase of two cars.

Based on the initial positions, speeds, and accelerations of the two cars, it simulates their motion assuming they are following the uniformly accelerated motion.

## How to run the app
This app can be run in different ways:
1. `python3 animation.py`  - run a simulation with predefined values of initial positions, speeds, and accelerations.
2. `python3 carchase_app_tk_pygubu.py` - run an app with graphic interface (GUI) that allows the user to choose the initial (at time = 0) positions, speeds, and accelerations of the cars as well as the time range of the simulation.
